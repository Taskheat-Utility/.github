## About Taskheat
Taskheat is a unique task management application that believes the best way to understand and manage your work is to see it. It replaces traditional linear lists with interactive visual maps, allowing you to arrange tasks as nodes and draw dependency lines between them. This approach is particularly powerful for projects with multiple steps, parallel workstreams, or complex sequences. By visualizing dependencies, you instantly understand what needs to happen first, what can be done simultaneously, and how delays in one area might impact others. It turns abstract project plans into concrete, actionable diagrams.

The application excels in planning and clarifying complex endeavors. Whether you're planning a product launch, a research paper, a home renovation, or a marketing campaign, Taskheat helps you deconstruct the project into actionable steps and lay them out logically. Its clean, gesture-based interface makes it easy to add, connect, and rearrange tasks. By focusing on the relationships between tasks rather than just a checklist, Taskheat provides a deeper level of project insight, helping you work more strategically and avoid overlooked dependencies that can derail timelines.
